# Explanation of Code

This code demonstrates a nested loop algorithm to find the nearest smaller values in an input array and presents the results in both normal and reversed orders.

## Code Overview

```javascript
const input = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15];
let result = [];
//expected output stored in result: [0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 6, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 7]

// First Loop
for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    
    // Second Loop
    for (var i2 = i; i2 >= 0; i2--) {

        if (input[i2] < input[i]) {
            result.push(input[i2]);
            break;
        }

    }

}

// Present it normally
console.log(result.join(" "));

// Present it backwards
console.log(result.reverse().join(" "));
```

# Explanation

1. Input Array (input):

    * An array containing a sequence of numbers.

2. Algorithm:

    * The code utilizes a nested loop structure.

    * The First Loop ( for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) ) iterates through each element of the input array by incrementing its index in each execution. (it's just an incremetal loop , it could be foreach and map loops also.)

    * The Second Loop ( for (var i2 = i; i2 >= 0; i2--) ) starts from the current element and goes backward. (here it's easier to use the for loop to decrement the index in each execution, getting a backwards behavior.)
    
    * Inside the Second Loop, if a smaller value than the current element is found, it is added to the result array, and the loop breaks.

3. Result Presentation:
    
    * The result array is presented in both normal and reversed orders using console.log.

    * The normal presentation as string, separated by space is achieved with result.join(" ").
    
    * The reversed presentation as string, separated by space is achieved with result.reverse().join(" ").

   > [!NOTE]  
   > **The Result array presents only the 15 values found from the initial 16 values, and the reason is that the fisrt index, in this case is the number 0, has no previous value inside the array, so it's ignored in this case, but some challanges may ask you to represt it in the result array as -1 or null ... in this cases you could add a condition inside the second loop to handle it.**
